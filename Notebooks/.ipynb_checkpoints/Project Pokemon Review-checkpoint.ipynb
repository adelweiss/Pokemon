       "      <td>copy of sword and shield come in the mail a bit early yesterday  and while sword and shield be pretty cute game  i have to admit there be some glaring problem that make this game feel like be need to bake in the oven a tad bit longer  for starter  i just want to say i never care for the controversy surround these game about not be able to transfer all of pokemon  so this review be in no way biased towards that  there be  however  other issue that do drag down the experience for  i often run into performance issue  frame drop  tree or object randomly pop up in view  and while at time the game do seem beautiful and comfy  at other point the game almost seem sloppily put together   the game be far too easy to the point of boredom  even for a pokemon game  i feel be overlevele very quickly  i be often take down opponent only in one singular attack  despite not go out of way to fight many monster  the new exp share  which spread experience across whole party  seem to amplify this problem  seem as if the game be not balance with this feature in mind  as entire team be several level ahead of opponent for most of if not  the entire game  the adventure last roughly about   hour for to complete  which be awfully short for an rpg  and there be not much can do after the journey be over  may i add this game only have   route  previous entry have about ish    i will not get into story spoiler in this review  but the game be a bit more linear than i be expect  main criticism stem from hop  happy  go  lucky friend and rival  who always seem to interrupt the flow  there be hardly a moment where can walk around without be interrupt by dialogue or a cutscene by or some other character  i audibly groan whenever hop appear on screen  i do like a good story  but i would also like to be able to play through the game without rival breathe down neck  trainer customisation in this game be something i appreciate  customize character be the wide have ever be in this series  complete with photogenic trainer card that capture the essence of character  i find this feature very wholesome and cute  with many expression and pose to choose from    i be look foward to see the wild area be a reimagine safari  zone full of life  but unfortunately  be large  empty  and barren  model walk around a bit stiffly  and the texture be a bit dated and lackluster for a console game in  animation from this game can either be very well do  or extremely lacking  there be one instance where one of the major pokemon in the story mode do not even have a turn animate for be walk cycle  the pokemon s entire model be just rotate   degree  which be very noticeable and bizarre  however  speak of which  i do like the very  set of pokemon this generation  there be quite a lot that be able to catch in the region  old and new  and be all pretty unique and sometimes goofy in design    the new feature  pokemon camp  be very charming  i love the animation in this mode  be definitely at peak here in term of quality  be quite entertaining to see scorbunny  raboot play with the feather wand toy i have  pokemon in camp interact with each other and feel very lively  make curry be cute  however  i do have problem with  for starter  the ai for the pokemon can seem a bit buggy  where may get stick walk in one place  i can not say be common but do break the immersion a bit  there be one instance where i have no background in the camp at all  which seem like a bug  but then i encounter a battle with a background very similar to this  and i can only assume be intentional  at time  i almost feel there be more time and effort put into this side  activity than the actual battle system    at be core  be definitely a pokemon game  the basic formula of pokemon work in these game  however  i be still disappointed  and i can without a doubt say that this be the least amount of enjoyment have get out of a mainline pokemon game so far  pokemon sword and shield fail to truly innovate despite be the first mainline entry on any type of console  and i can not say that be a sixty dollar pokemon game at all  feel rush  poorly optimize  and half  baked  can i see a child enjoy this game  yes  can i see a newcomer to the series enjoy this game  possibly  can i see a longtime pokemon fan enjoy this game  not likely  unfortunately</td>\n",
